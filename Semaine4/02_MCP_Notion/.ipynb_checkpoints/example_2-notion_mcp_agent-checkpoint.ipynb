      "- **Purpose:** Share a practical, counterintuitive strategy for staying motivated, based on the title “don’t do it for yourself.” The goal is to educate and provide a concrete perspective on motivation, not generic inspiration.\n",
      "- **Target Audience:** Builders, entrepreneurs, technical creators, and solopreneurs who struggle with motivation and want actionable advice.\n",

      "- **Meat:** Explain why “doing it for yourself” can backfire, possibly due to self-imposed pressure or unclear goals. Suggest concrete alternative(s): do it for a client, a friend, an audience, or to deliver value to someone specific. Maybe share that accountability or creating for others brings consistency.\n",

When you create for others (even just one person), there’s built-in accountability and feedback. That outside perspective gives your work urgency and makes it easier to keep going, even on hard days.\n",
